### Information
	- **app.js** registers the dependencies (i.e., modules needed to run the app).

	- **listingController.js** - is a file that holds the code that Angular.js uses to control 
		what is rendered on the browser in response to a user's interaction with the website

	- **listingFactory.js** - is that same content that we had in our listings.json file for 
		Assignment #1 but formatted into an object that Angular.js can manipulate

### Assignment Objectives
	- modify the **listingController.js** file to  display listings, 
	as well as the ability to add new listings and delete old ones.

### Tasks 
Map out how the different files communicate with one another.
There is a *factory*, a *controller*, and a *view* (provided by the index.html page)
It is your responsibility to:

	1. Complete the methods in the controller
	2. Implement the prompts in the HTML view to make the application functional
